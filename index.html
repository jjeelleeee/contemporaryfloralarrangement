	<center><img src="honeydew.png" alt="hey" title="SELECTION OF TRAPPING SITES: Selection of a trap site will depend on two main criteria. First priority is a suitable host. Second, the host should also meet the conditions for trap placement as described under Hanging the Trap. Assuming uniform host distribution, then uniform trap distribution should also be achieved. Good host selection takes precedence over trap distribution. &#13; &#13;HANGING THE TRAP: Traps should be placed in the upper 1/2 to 1/3 of the tree canopy, about two feet from the outer ends of the branches. Maintain a space of 12 inches to 18 inches around the trap; foliage and ripening fruit should surround the trap beyond that distance, particularly to the bottom and sides. Traps should never be hung below the foliage canopy, nor should they be closer than four feet to the ground. Be sure the trap is visible in filtered sunlight. Direct sun is acceptable as long as the other criteria for placement are met. Use the south (preferable), east or west sides of trees." ></center>
